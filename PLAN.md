- **Dependencies Updated**: Upgraded pion/webrtc from v2.0.12 to v3.3.6 and updated Go modules
- **Client Dependencies**: Updated WebRTC adapter.js to version 8.2.3
- **Compilation**: Project now builds and compiles successfully

### üöß **In Progress**
- Testing local and Docker deployment
- Verifying all static file references work correctly
- Testing publisher and join pages for 404 errors
- Phase 2.1: Connection lifecycle management and cleanup (COMPLETED)
- Phase 2.2: Improved Error Handling (COMPLETED)

### ‚è≥ **Next Priority**

- Phase 2.3: WebRTC Improvements (TURN server configuration)
- Phase 3.1: Performance Optimizations

## Current Issues Analysis

### Critical Issues (Blocking Basic Functionality)
- [x] **Port Configuration Mismatch**: `.env` specifies port 8088 but `docker-compose.yml` expects 8588
- [x] **Missing JavaScript Files**: Templates reference non-existent `join.js` and `publish.js` files (Fixed: Templates now reference existing `connect.js`)
- [x] **Severely Outdated Dependencies**: WebRTC v2.0.12 from 2019, Go crypto packages with security vulnerabilities (Updated to WebRTC v3.3.6)
- [ ] **Race Conditions**: No cleanup of peer connections, goroutine leaks in PLI ticker

### High Priority Issues
- [ ] **Excessive Panic Usage**: Using `panic()` instead of proper error handling
- [ ] **Memory Leaks**: Missing connection cleanup when clients disconnect
- [ ] **No Connection Monitoring**: Missing ICE connection state monitoring and recovery
- [ ] **Missing TURN Configuration**: Only STUN server configured, preventing NAT traversal

### Medium Priority Issues
- [ ] **Browser Compatibility**: Outdated WebRTC adapter.js reference
- [ ] **Single Track Bottleneck**: All clients share one track, creating performance issues
- [ ] **Missing Validation**: No SDP offer validation or malformed data handling
- [ ] **Poor Error Messages**: Generic error responses without context

## Notes & Considerations

### Technical Debt
- The current codebase has significant technical debt from outdated dependencies
- WebRTC v2 ‚Üí v4 migration will require substantial API changes
- Consider rewriting core components vs. incremental fixes

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern WebRTC APIs have better reliability
- Consider dropping support for very old browsers
- Test thoroughly on mobile browsers

### Production Readiness
- Current code is prototype-level, not production-ready
- Security considerations need significant attention
- Scalability limits with current architecture

### Timeline Estimates
- Phase 1: 3-5 days (critical fixes)
- Phase 2: 5-7 days (core functionality)  
- Phase 3: 7-10 days (reliability)
- Phase 4: 2-3 weeks (advanced features)

**Total estimated effort: 4-6 weeks for full implementation**
